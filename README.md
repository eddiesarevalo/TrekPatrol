# Trek Patrol

"Trek Patrol" is a fork of "Planet Patrol" which is a demonstration monitoring and notification system for the [Planetary Data System](https://pds.nasa.gov/). It keeps tabs of essential websites, APIs, and other online endpoints, files tickets when things aren't working, makes notifications (when configured to do so), and keeps things up and running, and neat and tidy.

## 🏃‍♀️ Getting Started

Check the documentation for [Upptime](https://upptime.js.org/) first. Then do a `git pull` because the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that powers this make numerous commits to the repository _all the time_. Then edit the `.upptimerc.yml` file and commit and push.

You can then view the results at [the Trek Patrol website](https://eddiesarevalo.github.io/TrekPatrol/) (powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)).

As systems go down, [issues are automatically filed and assigned](https://github.com/eddiesarevalo/TrekPatrol/issues) (powered by [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)).
